# Quikreads Frontend

Reading books is amazing but the time that goes for reading a book is heavy and consuming. Itâ€™s always amazing to audit a book or if the summary of the book is known quicker. 


Quickbit helps in getting your favourite and suggested books in one platform interactively by summarizing the book in the form of videos, text, flashcards and much more. Books are suggested based on your interest and Quickbit helps you in summarizing the book in various formats which takes max 15 minutes to understand a book.
